I'm Mary Ogunmola, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where I conduct research in **Confidential Computing** under the supervision of [Professor Robert Ricci](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ricci/) at the [Flux Research Group](https://www.flux.utah.edu/). My research focuses on leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to secure data-in-use, addressing critical privacy challenges in modern computing infrastructure.

My current work investigates the integration of hardware-assisted security mechanisms to secure 5G network functions in third-party cloud environments.

Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a Software Engineer, where I focused on building robust applications and automating secure deployment pipelines. I also have a strong background in cloud computing and I'm passionate about making technical knowledge more accessible through writing.
